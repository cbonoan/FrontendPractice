## Overview 

I will include all my completed challenges under the [Completed](#completed) tab. Each completed project will include at least two screenshots, one that will show the how the web page looks on small devices such as mobile devices. The other screenshot will show how it looks on a desktop. 

All challenges were completed with the design idea of [mobile first](https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00).

### Chat App

With this challenge, the only assets I was given was the avatar and dog images. The real challenge was to create everything else using CSS. The background, phone, messages, basically everything besides the images was created using vanilla CSS.
